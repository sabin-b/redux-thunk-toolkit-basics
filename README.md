# Redux Basics Repository

This repository contains basic implementations of Redux, Redux Thunk, and Redux Toolkit. It demonstrates how to manage state effectively in a React application using these powerful libraries.

## Features:
- **Redux**: Implemented state management with actions, reducers, and store.
- **Redux Thunk**: Added middleware for handling asynchronous actions.
- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplified Redux setup and code structure with slices and the `configureStore` API.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

redux installation:

1. npm i redux

2. npm i react-redux

3. npm i redux-thunk - skip

4) npm i redux-devtools-extension --force - skip

5) npm i @reduxjs/toolkit (both install 3, 4 steps)
